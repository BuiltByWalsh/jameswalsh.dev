title: ES 2023 Immutable Arrays
description: ES2023 was released in September of this year. And this release ships with a handful of incredibly useful array methods that solve for some of JavaScripts bigger side-effects that are also easy to miss. In today's post we'll talk about those methods, and why they can save you lots of time, and headaches.

## What's New in JavaScript?

If you‚Äôre anything like me it was easy to miss some small, but powerful features that were introduced in ES14 a few months before the time of this writing. For example, `Array.prototype` just got way better in some subtle, but powerful ways.

## New Array Methods ‚ú®

```tsx
Array.prototype.toSpliced()
Array.prototype.toSorted()
Array.prototype.toReversed()
Array.prototype.with()
```

With the exception of `with()` all of these new methods provide similar functionality to their predecessor methods; `splice` , `sort` , & `reverse`.
The big change here has to do with array mutations. These old-school methods act like stateful object-oriented methods, & mutate the state of the array instance they are called upon.

<br />
Conversely, each of these new array methods behave as a `Functor` _(you can check out my write-up on functors [here](/posts/tenets-of-functional-programming#tenet-5-functors-Ô∏è))_.
The resulting "mutation" always executes on a brand new copy of the array returning the new result. No mutations happen to
the array instance the function was called upon.

<br />

This change is pretty useful when working with method chaining. Let‚Äôs take a look at this in action while solving the following [Code Wars Kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/576b93db1129fcf2200001e6/solutions/typescript?filter=all&sort=best_practice&invalids=false).

## Shifting from Mutable to Immutable

The code wars problem we're going to solve looks like this:

> Sum all the numbers of a given array, except the highest, & the lowest element (by value, not by index)

First we need to sort the array, then remove the first, & last elements, then return the sum. Classically in JavaScript this could look something like this:

```jsx
export function sumArray(array) {
  const sortedArray = array.sort((a, b) => a - b)

  sortedArray.shift()
  sortedArray.pop()

  return sortedArray.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)
}
```

At first glance, the code is all pretty concise, & understandable.

- We sort the array in ascending order with `sort`.
- `shift` to remove the first/smallest number.
- `pop` to remove the last/largest number
- `reduce` to sum the result.

## Problems with Classic Array Methods

For me, the code above feels stiff, & uncomfortable. Here are the problems that stand out

1. The sort mutation can have negative side effects.
1. The `shift`, & `pop` methods break up what could otherwise be accomplished with full function chaining.
1. Most of the negative side effects of this code are happening implicitly, & need to be carefully remembered by hard lessons learned.

### Sort Mutation

Hot take, **JS Sort mutations kinda suck**. But they‚Äôre the best we‚Äôve had for a long time unless you reach for libraries like `lodash` or `ramda` which offer immutable sort functions. Let‚Äôs take a look at the first line of our function body:

```jsx
const sortedArray = array.sort((a, b) => a - b)
```

While the `sort` method returns the new sorted array, it also **_mutated the parameter that was passed in_**. This is now a side effect we have to keep track of. To remove this side-effect, & make our function pure, historically we would do something like use the spread operator to copy the array inside our function body before sorting:

```jsx
const sortedArray = [...array].sort((a, b) => a - b)
```

But with the new `toSorted` method the following works just the same, & we don‚Äôt need to use the spread operator at all:

```jsx
const sortedArray = array.toSorted((a, b) => a - b)
```

### Element Removal Mutation

The other portion of the function that has my eyes watery is the `shift`, & `pop` pieces up above.
If we hadn‚Äôt just refactored our sort functionality, we would have removed items from the original array with no way to reset back to our original state.
That old array is gone forever, so we better hope no other part of the codebase relied on it for other computations _(spoiler alert, it usually comes back to bite you)_.

This isn‚Äôt as big of a problem now that we‚Äôre mutating the **_copied_** parameter via `toSorted`. Even still, we can improve this code with `toSpliced`.
In classic JavaScript we could refactor our `shift`, & `pop` code using `splice`:

```jsx
sortedArray.splice(0, 1)
sortedArray.splice(-1, 1)
```

But since we now have `toSpliced` which returns a copied array with the result of the splice operation, we‚Äôve got some huge wins.

1. We‚Äôve prevented accidental deletion of array elements no matter what, without needing to depend on the previous line containing `toSorted`
2. We can take our entire function body a step further with some sweet functional chaining.
   Since all of these methods are functors we‚Äôve unlocked our [Referential Transparency](https://www.sitepoint.com/what-is-referential-transparency/) badge.

The final ES2024 version of the code is massively simplified, & far safer, all while using convenient function chaining üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª.

```jsx
export function sumArray(array) {
  return array
    .toSorted((a, b) => a - b)
    .toSpliced(0, 1)
    .toSpliced(-1, 1)
    .reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)
}
```

### With()

If you‚Äôre curious why I didn‚Äôt talk about with, I plan to write a follow-up post later dedicated to this method, because the implications are pretty cool. In the meantime, check out the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/with)

## Cost to Performance üèÉ

As with most things in life, these new tools involve measuring trade-offs. Technically speaking these new methods are more expensive than the older methods. Since physics is still physics, & there aren‚Äôt any breakthroughs in science that have shattered my perceptions of how computation works, _yes copying a bunch of bits is always more expensive than adding or removing specific bits to a known part of the heap_.

### The known drawbacks are

- Garbage collection will take longer.
- You're using more memory at any given point in time.
- Slower time to execute.

### Mutations Are Still Useful When

- You are working with incredibly large lists.
- Working to reduce your `O^n` for a given part of your codebase.
- You can limit, & carefully place your application side effects inside just a handful of well-tested functions.
- At the beginning of any unit of work you have a `reset` function that can help you bounce back to your initial state for either debugging or other computations that needs to happen elsewhere.

### Dont Sweat Performance Yet (Probably)

Throughout the day as a full-stack web developer, my priorities are maximizing safety, & readability, while reducing customer bugs. This approach supports that.
If you need to ship code with an incredibly small runtime footprint to a resource-constrained device like an IoT device, are dealing with a part of your codebase that's already dealing with scaling issues,
or work in game development where resource efficiency is incredibly important; you could justify a refactor the total opposite direction.

<br />
But for most of us, the caution here is that premature optimization can cause software rot. Most of the time I'm focused
on building cool reliable web-based things on modern devices, where we need tons of interactivity with safety baked-in. I
see these new array methods as the natural progression of what the language should offer, which continues to get us closer
to feature parody with open source libraries developers have reached for in the past. Until copying lists proves to be a
problem in a particular codebase, this is my approach. We can always be more cautious as cases arise naturally. But for most
of us, these new methods solve for bugs caused by bad mutations, with totally manageable trade-offs.

<br />
Cheers! ü§ô
