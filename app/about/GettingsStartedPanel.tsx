      Fast forward to summer of 2014, I was working full-time while taking a
      semester off from my business management major. Spring Semester had left
      me feeling like I was approaching an intersection in life. I knew my major
      wasn&apos;t a great fit, but I wasn&apos;t sure what was next. One night
      in early June 2014, I was drivng home bursting with excitement because for
      the first time ever I was going to boot up my new <b>Gaming PC</b>. As I
      thought about pressing the power button on my new gaming rig, a thought
      popped into my head that I couldn&apos;t get rid of. Instead of playing
      games tonight, What if I sat down at the keyboard and just tried to build
      something... Earlier that day, one of my teammates had mentioned that they
      were transitioning onto the software development team. And hearing that
      made something spark in my brain. Rather than rushing home every night to
      tinker with computers, I wanted to understand how they worked. I wanted to
      see if it was viable for me to make a career out of this, not a night time
      hobby. What came next was a summers long blur of mastering HTML, CSS, and
      beginning to read a books on JavaScript and Ruby. Before I knew it summer
      had ended, Fall was here and I was enrolled in DevMountain, a fully
      immersive full stack JavaScript bootcamp. Each day and I felt newfound
      excitement every time I walked out the front door to catch the train and
      head to class.
